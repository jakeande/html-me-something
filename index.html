                            <ul>
                                <li>Worked in a pharmacy off and on for many years since 2006</li>
                                <li>when I was in college I worked in a kitchen, I wanted to take a break from the pharmacy life and try something else out. I started out with the glamorous job of dish washing. This was a mindless job to me. I did this for about a month and then was moved into prep cook position. This was great, I learned knife skills, and how to cook anything that would be at an irish restaurnt. I fell in love with cooking at that point</li>
                                <li>Went to find a job as a sioux chef, and found a position at a deli/restaurant. This was a great experience I worked under two amazing chefs, who taugt me the ends in out of how the kitchen. Only, problem with this job was the time it took away from my studies in college. So I decided That it was best to leave.</li>
                                <li>I decided to try and work in a technology field for a little. So, I ended up with a job at CPR Cell Phone Repair. I was tasked with learning to basically fix any electronic that would come into the store. This was exelerating. I was faced with a new challenge every couple of days that I have never seen before. Worked there until I could not afford to work there any longer.
                                <li>Went back to work at Longtermcare Rx and worked there until I could longer recieve a raise unless I was a phamacist. At this point it was time to find my next venture.

                    </header>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Where do I see my self in five years? Well, I asked my self this question about a year before I applied to LaunchCode. It was time to find a job that I would fall in love with. I started looking into coding. The first time I looked at code was like waking up from a hibernation. It seemed that my desire for technology was greater then I once thought. </li>
                                <li> At this point I started to look into places to learn how to code. I was desiring a class room environment which was supprising to me because I was never much of a school body, I would rather work then go to school any day. So I looked around and found either that I would have to go to college or university. I decided to do some outsourcing and asked my friends if they new anything about coding or new anyone that coded. This was a great idea, because one of my good friends told me about launchcode. I decided to apply and was accepted.</li>
                                <li>Once, I finish at LaunchCode I hope to find a job that is rewarding. The jobs that I would interest me most would be the ones that end up helping some one in the end. This is because I have always hide a drive to help people.</li>
